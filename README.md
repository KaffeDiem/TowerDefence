# TowerDefence

An isometric tower defence game made in **LÃ–VE** with Lua. It supports **Mac OS, Windows, iOS and Android** (very much cross-platform). The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible by saving the princess, making it an endless Tower Defence game.
Maps are randomly generated and so are the waves which you will fight!

This is VERY much still in development, but below are some images giving you an idea of the art. The content of this repository does not contain images for the project, only the source code.
